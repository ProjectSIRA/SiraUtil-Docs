# Intro

The Object Redecoration system allows modders to modify or replace the models for certain objects.

Currently, the two objects supported are the `GameNoteController` and `MultiplayerConnectedPlayerGameNoteController` prefabs (basically notes).

This system supports priority and chaining. Chaining allows multiple mods to make changes to an object, ordered by priority.
