# What is Zenject?

[Zenject](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject) is a dependency injection framework for Unity. It is heavily used in Beat Saber and SiraUtil. Please visit [this link](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject) to learn more about the library and how to learn it. I **highly recommend** you read over the beginning concepts of Zenject such as:
* `Installer`s
* `[Inject]` attribute
* Kernel interfaces suchs as `IInitializable`, `IDisposable`, and `ITickable`
* `DiContainer`s
* `AsSingle()` and `AsTransient()`
* `SceneContext`s
* How to bind classes and the differences and similarities between `Bind`, `BindInterfacesTo` and `BindInterfacesAndSelfTo`

There is also a [video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKERDLXpXl_jNJPY2czQcfPXW4BJaGZc_) made by Infallible Code which is a good crash course and I **highly** recommend you watch it.

The tutorial section of this documentation site will passively teach you how some concepts work, but it is not a complete substitute.
