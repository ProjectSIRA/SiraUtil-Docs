# What is Dependency Injection?

[Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) which has been increasing in populatity in the C# programming language.

It is used in Beat Saber and in SiraUtil through the [Zenject](what-is-zenject) library.

If you've never heard of dependency injection before, I highly recommend you read the linked wikipedia article above. If you are a more visual learner, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6EVfmUgX60) and or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKD2-MAkXyQ).

Dependency injection is incredibly powerful and it helps decouple your code, reduces overhead, makes refactoring much easier and organizes your workflow.
