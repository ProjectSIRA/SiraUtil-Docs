### History

The initial project for SiraUtil was created on **June 14th, 2020**.

The original purpose of SiraUtil was to hook into the Zenject system and create an API to make extra sabers for the rewrite/resurrection of ChromaToggle. This was the birth of SiraUtil 0.

SiraUtil 1 released on **August 31st, 2020**. Some more things were added such as SiraSabers, a better API for hooking into Zenject, saber providers, and more. This was also around the time when SiraUtil 2 started development. Over the next two months, SiraUtil 1 also gained a localization system, SiraEvents, FPFC, and SongControl.

SiraUtil 2 was released on **October 23rd, 2020** after the Beat Saber 1.12 multiplayer update. It was much more in-depth with a rewritten Zenject API, exposers, mutators, short circuiters, sprite loaders, the web client, more localization features, score submission, the model provider system, and more. SiraUtil 2 got continual updates up until the release of the Hive project.

SiraUtil 3 aims to be a complete rewrite of the internal and external systems to have an incredibly clean and well documented codebase alongside an even more friendly API to use.
